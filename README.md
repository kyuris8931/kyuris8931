## 🔭 What I'm Focused On: Gamicraft

My primary focus is developing [**Gamicraft**](https://github.com/kyuris8931/Gamicraft-Project), a unique and modular gamification framework built for Android.

**What is Gamicraft?**
Gamicraft goes beyond simple tracking. It deeply integrates your real-life productivity and habits (tracked via the **LifeUp** app) with custom, interactive mini-game experiences built using **Tasker** and **KLWP**. The goal is to make self-improvement genuinely engaging and fun!

**Core Philosophy:**
* **Growth to Win:** Real-world progress directly fuels your capabilities within Gamicraft.
* **Productivity as Privilege:** Framing challenging tasks as valuable opportunities unlocked via gameplay.
* **High Modularity & Customization:** A framework, not a single game, allowing for diverse modules.
* **User Empowerment ("Your Game, Your Rules"):** Giving you control over your gamified journey, even without coding skills (thanks to Tasker/KLWP flexibility).
* **Short Play Sessions:** Designed for quick (~1-3 min) interactions that fit into daily life.
